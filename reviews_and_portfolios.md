# Reviews/Portfolios

1. Complete Portfolio
2. Pass Review
3. Access Careers Fair and Jobs Board

# Portfolio

## What?
- The portfolio is something that is done just for you and coaches, not employers. It covers much of the same ground as a CV or technical interview, so the act of completing the portfolio is also helpful in that way.

## When?
- You can complete it at any time during or after the course.

## Why?
- When Ed decides that your portfolio is good enough, you will be allowed to book a review (Passing the review gives you access to jobs with hiring partners).

# Review

## What?
- Like a basic technical test, you will be given a task to complete by a coach, who will observe you as you complete it.
- You will find out straight away whether or not you’ve passed, and you’ll be given feedback either way.

## When?
- Every other Monday and Tuesday, by appointment, once you have your portfolio okayed by Ed.

## Why?
- This is for coaches to decide whether you are job ready.
- If you pass, you will be allowed to go to Careers Fairs and try to get a job from the companies who attend. You will also be given access to a jobs board for people who have passed reviews.
