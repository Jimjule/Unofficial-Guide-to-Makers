# Final Project

## When?
- The Final Two Weeks (Weeks 11 & 12)

## What?
- Whatever your team of 4 or 5 decides on

## How?
- Friday week 10, you’ll all brainstorm your ideas on a whiteboard, which will then be grouped into categories by a coach.
- Everyone then gets a 1st and 2nd choice of the categories, and you are grouped based on those choices.
- You find out your group on week 11 Monday, and then you decide what your project is.
- You can change category if your team agrees to it.

## Other Info
- Groups can do similar or identical projects.
- It doesn’t have to be original, but it should be in some way different from what you’ve done so far.
- You will present it on the Friday week 12, but it doesn’t have to be finished.
- You can try to make a finished product, but people also choose to do ‘learning’ projects, where the presentation is focused on what was learned.
